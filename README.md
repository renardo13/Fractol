Fractol is a project that visualizes fractal sets (such as the Mandelbrot or Julia sets) using the graphics library MiniLibX (commonly called ‚Äúmlx‚Äù).
With this project you‚Äôll learn how to render complex mathematical images, handle user interaction (mouse, keyboard) and manage graphics pipeline in C.

### Usage

-> Clone the mlx library

```bash
git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git mlx
cd mlx
make
```


Implements fractal generation and rendering logic (iteration, escape time algorithm).

Uses the MiniLibX library (‚Äúmlx‚Äù) for window creation, pixel drawing and event handling.

You‚Äôll treat mlx like a ‚Äúlib 11‚Äù style library (i.e., a minimalistic custom graphics library provided by your curriculum) ‚Äî low-level, simple API, direct control.

Supports zooming, moving the view, changing colors and maybe switching between fractal types.

Built in C with a Makefile, handling memory, events and performance.
